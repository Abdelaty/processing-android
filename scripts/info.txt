Collection of utility scripts that I put here for the lack of a better place. They 
probably should become tasks/targets in the gradle/ant build scripts at some point.

perm-parse.py: generates the array of permissions for a given SDK level, to be pasted in
Permissions.java

support-update.sh: Explodes the support aar files from the local SDK repository, 
and extracts the classes jar and copies it inside core/library

wear-update.sh: downloads the wearable aar file from a known maven repository, and 
extracts the classes jar and copies it inside core/library

gvrsdk-update.sh: downloads the Google VR SDK and generates all required packages and jar
files needed to build and run VR sketches from Processing

gradlew-update.sh: creates the gradle wrapper with the desired gradle version and packs
it in the mode folder to be available when exporting projects using gradle as the build 
system
