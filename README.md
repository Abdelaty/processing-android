Processing for Android
======================

Repository for all Android-related development for Processing. It is kept separate from the main project so it does not hamper progress on the desktop side, and in the hope that others will be more inclined to help and contribute on this isolated portion of the project.

This is primarily the source for the Android Mode, with the 'core' library found inside a subfolder of the same name. 

Please note that the core library is released under the [GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html), while the mode itself uses the  [GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2] (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html). 
This means that you can use the core library to develop your apps without having to release the source code if you don't want to. However, any derivative of
the mode must to remain under the GPL.  

Please help us keep this code up to date and debugged by making fixes and submitting your pull requests here. The entire Processing project is developed by a tiny number of people working during their free time, and we could really use the help.
